To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.

If music be the food of love, play on;
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken and so die.

We are such stuff as dreams are made on;
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten loreâ€”
